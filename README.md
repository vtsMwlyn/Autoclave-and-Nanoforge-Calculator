# Autoclave-and-Nanoforge-Calculator
This apps inspired by an online game Growtopia, there are 2 unique items called "Autoclave" and "Startool Nanoforge". Autoclave itself can convert 20 of the same surgery tools into 1 of each other surgery tools (there should be 12 other tools) meanwhile Startool Nanoforge can convert 20 of the same startopia tools into 1 of each other startopia tools (there should be 11 other tools).
So people often use this for in game profit method. Among surgery tools, the only tool that expensive is surgical stitches and most of other tools is having much cheaper price. This also happens to startopia tools where the tools that expensive is tactical drone and teleporter charge.
Because of this reason, players especially those who sell surgery and/or startopia tools will convert the entire tools they have (except of surgical stitches or tactical drone and teleporter charge) to surgical stitches or tactical drone and teleporter charge.
This calculator can help simulate the system without losing the real item and the result will be visualized in the apps.
